## Introduction 


Based on events since the start of the local COVID-19 epidemic, and as at the time of writing, there have been widespread governmental public health interventions, centred around social/physical distancing, with gradually liberalised RT-PCR testing criteria, allied with ongoing case-based interventions (case identification and isolation, contact tracing and quarantining), together with near closure of the borders and mandatory quarantine for all arrivals. These measures have resulted in an impressive reduction in incident cases across Australia, a few localised of point source outbreaks notwithstanding, to the point that Australia is now close to elimination of local transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 

### From "flattening the curve" to "keep it flat"

The compartment model of [Moss _et al_. (2020)](https://www.doherty.edu.au/uploads/content_doc/McVernon_Modelling_COVID-19_07Apr1_with_appendix.pdf), as announced by Prime Minister Morrison and published as a preprint by the Doherty Institute, appears to have been constructed prior to the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia (that is, prior to Feb 2020) and appears to have been primarily designed to assess the potential impact of COVID-19 on the Australian hospital system. As described, it allows for modelling of the following interventions or behavioural modifications aimed at reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection:
 
* isolation of cases (defined as "confirmed by a medical practitioner")
* voluntary self-quarantine of contacts of cases
* indefinite (ongoing), fixed levels of physical/social distancing
* an indefinite (ongoing) fixed level of imported cases

This model may have been useful for informing the Autralian response in February and early March 2020, but different models are now required.

It is now clear that there needs to be a paradigm shift from "flattening the curve", with the aim of keeping the prevalent number of serious cases below hospital and ICU capacity, to "keeping it flat", with the aim of preventing the number of undetected local transmission chains from rising (due to restricted testing and poor self-isolation), and to prevent  the number of detected local transmission chains from outstripping the capacity of case-based public health interventions (isolation. contact tracing and quarantine) to suppress them.

There are a large number of resulting research and policy questions relating to this "exit strategy" from the economically and socially harmful widespread social distancing measures which we have seen in March and April 2020. With these questions in mind, we propose the model described below, dubbed _**COVOID-d**_, to permit exploration of future scenarios involving both current and likely future interventions and behaviours, such as:

* self-isolation if symptomatic (even minor symptoms), pending readily available testing (including drive-through testing, testing-at-home with mobile teams coming to you, and even self-swabbing kits as being trialled in some countries);
* introduction of serological testing with expected much lower specificity than current RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) testing for shedding of viral RNA, but with the ability to detect resolved, historical infection and thus provide information on "herd immunity" (with uncertainty) 
* varying levels of social distancing;
* school closure, tertiary education closure or partial closure (eg small tutorials but not lectures);
* time-varying numbers of imported cases due to imperfect quarantining of overseas arrivals (currently citizen and permanent resident repatriation but this may be liberalised in the next few months);
* enhanced and more efficient contact tracing through scaled-up public health workforces and deployment of low-power BlueTooth mobile-phone-assisted contact tracing (the COVIDSafe app);
* serological testing and serosurveys of (stratified) random samples of the population;
* vaccination prioritisation, allowing for imperfect efficacy of first generation vaccines (which may use relatively novel mRNA technologies)

### Modelling critical public health intervention capacities

So far, focus of most modelling groups has been on ICU capacity, in particular ventilated beds, and implicitly ECMO (extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation) capacity. However, with the near-elimination scenarios which now seem likely in Australia (as well as New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan, with other countries to follow), it is far less likely that ICU or even general hospital capacity will be overwhelmed unless control of local epidemic transmission is lost. Such loss of control is entirely possible, as evinced by Japan and Singapore, both of which had their initial COVID-19 outbreaks under control through moderate social distancing allied with strong case-based interventions, but subsequently suffered significant spread as the number of cases overwhelmed case-based containment efforts. However, to ensure prevention such failures of control when local transmission and external seeding by imported cases have been reduced to low numbers, it is important to consider not hospital treatment capacity but public health intervention capacity.

These case-based public health capacities comprise:

* border control, specifically rigorous quarantining (and increasingly, repeated serial testing) of all arrivals
* case isolation for those tested positive, and facilitation of swift and effective self-isolation for pre-test potential cases
* easy access to testing for those with any relevant symptoms
* case detection through widespread _ad hoc_ or organised sampled testing of the wider, asymptomatic population
* contact tracing and contact quarantine (with daily follow-up, and potentially, testing) 

These capacities are largely constrained by the public health workforce size and lab capacity, including RT-PCR reagent supplies and lab personnel capacity.

Using our candidate model, described below, we will be able to model scenarios in which each or all of the above capabilities are constrained at current levels, and examine the impact of increasing amounts of local transmission which might overwhelm such capacity. This appears to be an overlooked risk in current COVID-19 control strategies as articulated by Australian government agencies.


## The Moss _et al._ (Doherty Institute) model

The structure of the Moss _et al_.) (2020) model (referred to henceforth as the 'Doherty model"), as described (and in the absence of any released source code for its implementation) is shown in the figure below, _sans_ the ICU capacity modelling sections. It is an adequate initial model which uses various "short-cuts" to approximate the modelling of certain scenarios.

We have re-implemented this as a dynamic (mathematical) model (which is the type used by Moss _et al_.) using the _EpiModel_ library and framework for _R_, and have used it to reproduce the rather sparse model outputs given in the Moss _et al._ paper, in order to demonstrate the faithfulness of the results obtained from our implementation to theirs. We will include our implementation of the Doherty model it in our released code, and mention it in any scientific papers based on this initiative, but we do not believe it is adequate for modelling purposes henceforth.

### COVOID-d model

The figure on the following page shows our **COVOID-d** model as currently implemented. Like the Doherty model, this also contains some inelegant but unavoidable duplication, in particular the almost complete branching of the model at an early stage to accommodate modelling of quarantine of asymptomatic contacts of cases (something which the Moss _et al_. model "fudges" through a mathematical short-cut). Nonetheless, the model is quite tractable and has the capabilities needed to explore most of the scenarios set out above. Black solid lines in the diagram which follows indicate transitions of persons between compartments; the red dashed lines indicate routes of infection. In theory, there should be an equivalent set of infectivity routes to the S^C^ compartment too, but we have assumed that route is negligible for the sake of simplicity and tractability of implementation.

### Contact matrices

Contacts between age groups are specified using POLYMOD matrices as described in Prem Kiesha, _et al_. "Projecting social contact matrices in 152 countries using contact surveys and demographic data." PLoS Computational Biology 13, no. 9 (2017) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005697 . Matrices are available for 152 countries covering work, educational, household and general social settings. 

Interventions can thus be specified not only by age group but also setting. In particular, this permits fine-grained modelling of full or partial school and university closures.

The use of CoMix matrices, recently published by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, to inform intervention-related reductions in interpersonal contact will be investigated (see https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/comix-impact-of-physical-distance-measures-on-transmission-in-the-UK.html). 

## Parameter estimation

Simulation models such as these are typically ill-conditioned and under-determined -- that is, there is insufficient observed data to properly estimate all the model parameters. However, most parameters can be constrained by background knowledge derived from previous epidemics, and intervention parameters are likewise constrained by what historical fact or known capacity or acceptability. 

Given these constraints, it is possible to use various methods that have been developed for optimisation of machine learning model hyperparameters, which also tend to be under-determined, to fine-tune simulation model values to optimise fit to observed data. We intend to explore the use of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) in the first instance as an efficient way to explore the parameter space in the presence of local minima. Such use of ABC for communicable disease model fitting is not novel, but it is as yet not widely used. There are several other methods which we may also be able to test for this purpose.

The goal is to find a robust method that permits routine updating of baseline parameters so that intervention scenarios may be re-evaluated as the current situaton changes. 

## Proposed user interface elements

In addition, we will provide a simple graphical user interface that will allow users to visualise the proposed transmission model, and interactively modified both the baseline model parameters and time-variant intervention parameters to explore results under different scenarios. 

The screenshots below are taken from currently implemented interfaces for the the Doherty Model, and a test SIR model. The proposed work will extend this user interface to cover the enhanced COVOID-d model described above, as well as provide mechanisms to store and compare the results of parameter and intervention sets.

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Proposed COVOID-d user interface - parameter specification"}

```

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Proposed COVOID-d user interface - time-variant parameter specification interface - users can point and click"}

knitr::include_graphics(path = here::here("vignettes/model-gui-2.png"))
```

This interface will be embedded as part of a downloadable _R_ package (see below), enabling it to be run by anyone on a laptop or desktop computer (Windows, Apple macOS and Linux supported) following about 10 minutes to install the free, open-source R statistical computing environment. We will provide detailed installation and usage notes. It will also be made available as an installation-free cloud-based web app which we will make available to  policy-makers and journalists.  

Users of the app will be able to generate and download customisable dynamic reports based on scenarios they define that summarise the results as well as document the underlying assumptions and model parameter settings.

\newpage

## Example model

What follows is a simple example of a COVID-19 epidemic simulation in a population of 4 million, using an SIR compartment model which we implemented as proof-of-concept for the incorporation of the POLYMOD contact matrices into an age-specific modelling framework. We have subsequently implemented the use of POLYMOD matrices in our enhanced model, described above. In this simple example, infection is assumed to be uniform across all age groups (this does not necessarily have to be the case). The model uses age distributions from ABS Census data.

`R` code is provided here as an illustration of the way more expert users will be able to use the COVOID library. However, much of what can be done  will also be able to be specified by less expert users via the web browser user interface. 

We start by specifying contact matrices and age distributions, and initialising the compartments.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
cm_oz <- import_contact_matrix("Australia","general")
p_age_oz <- import_age_distribution("Australia")
S0 <- p_age_oz*4e6
I0 <- rep(1,16)
R0 <- rep(0,length(S0))
```

First we will consider the model without any intervention. The parameters for the basic reproduction ratio and $\gamma$ are taken from other published SIR models for COVID-19. Only four lines of code are needed to specify and run the model, and to examine the results.

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.width=7}
param <- sir_c_param(R0 = 2.5,gamma = 0.1,cm=cm_oz,dist=p_age_oz)
state0 <- sir_c_state0(S0 = S0,I0 = I0,R0 = R0)
res <- simulate_sir_c(t = 200,state_t0 = state0,param = param)
plot(res,y=c("S","I","R"),main="No intervention")
```

## Interventions

We can add in time varying interventions using the `create_intervention()` function we have defined in our library. The following example reduces all contact by 20%, simulating mild physical/social distancing. Note that the timing of the intervention can be specified, but any arbitrarily complex function can be passed to provide time-variant intervention levels. Such functions have access to intermediate model results, so that is is possible to define adaptive intervention functions such as "increase social distancing by 30% if daily incident cases rise above some threshold". 

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.width=7}
phys_dist = contact_intervention(start = 10,stop = 150,reduce = 0.8,start_delay = 5,stop_delay = 5)
param <- sir_c_param(R0 = 2.5,gamma = 0.1,cm=cm_oz,dist=p_age_oz,contact_intervention = phys_dist)
state0 <- sir_c_state0(S0 = S0,I0 = I0,R0 = R0)
res <- simulate_sir_c(t = 200,state_t0 = state0,param = param)
plot(res,y=c("S","I","R"),main="Physical distancing")
```

Our `covoid` package also allows separation of contact rates in different settings - e.g. school, work and home. Here are general and school contact matrices:

```{r,echo=TRUE, fig.height=2.5,fig.width=7}
cm_oz_all <- import_contact_matrix("Australia","general")
cm_oz_sch <- import_contact_matrix("Australia","school")
# separate out school and general population contact rates
cm_oz_all = cm_oz_all - cm_oz_sch
p_all <- plot(cm_oz_all) + labs(title = "General") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=6, angle=0),
          axis.text.y = element_text(size=6))
p_sch <- plot(cm_oz_sch) + labs(title = "School") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=6, angle=0),
          axis.text.y = element_text(size=6))
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p_all,p_sch,ncol=2)
```

We can then use these contact matrices in time varying interventions using `create_intervention()` for each setting. The below example reduces general contact by 20% to simulate general physical distancing combined with a reduction in school age contact by 80% to simulate almost complete school closures.

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.width=7}
cm = list(all = cm_oz_all, sch = cm_oz_sch)
int = list(sch=contact_intervention(start = 10,stop = 150,reduce = 0.2,start_delay = 5,stop_delay = 5),
           all=contact_intervention(start = 10,stop = 150,reduce = 0.8,start_delay = 5,stop_delay = 5))
param <- sir_c_param(R0 = 2.5,gamma = 0.1,cm=cm,dist=p_age_oz,contact_intervention = int)
state0 <- sir_c_state0(S0 = S0,I0 = I0,R0 = R0)
res <- simulate_sir_c(t = 200,state_t0 = state0,param = param)
plot(res,y=c("S","I","R"),main="Physical distancing + school closures")
```

In the following model, we assume that children under 15 are less infectious (a proposition for which there is some, but not conclusive, evidence) and that everyone starts wearing facemasks (as currently being promoted in Germany and several other countries).

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.width=7}
im = matrix(1,ncol=16,nrow=16)

## Funding and proposed work

To date, all work on COVID-19 modelling undertaken by the COVOID team has been undertaken without specific or program funding. The work was initiated due to the importance and urgency of the situation, and the perceived gaps in national and international modelling capability (which still exist). However, our work on these models cannot continue for much longer without specific project funding. Thus we are seeking seed or bridging funding to enable continuing development while we simultaneously seek further funding from various sources. Funding of $20,000 in two tranches of $10,000 is requested, with the second tranche contingent on mutually agreed completion of the first tranche. Funds will be used to backfill 0.8 FTE of the positions of Oisin Fitzgerald and Dr Mark Hanly, who are employed in the Centre for Big Data Research in Health (CBDRH) at lecturer/research fellow level A and B rates respectively, allowing them to devote four days per week to this work from the second week of May until the second week of July 2020. 

Together with in-kind contributions from other COVOID team members (including Dr Tim Churches providing coding assistance, quality assurance, technical steering and public health practice inputs, and Professor Raina MacIntyre, providing expertise in epidemic modelling and control, including vaccination strategies, and disease transmission mechanisms and dynamics), we expect to be able to reach the following goals by the end of June 2020:

The work will be carried out using agile project management methods, with all project artefacts (including manuscripts and documentation) captured in git version control repositories hosted by GitHub. Released versions will be made available via public GitHub repositories (the standard distribution mechanism for R packages prior to acceptance by CRAN, the canonical R package ecosystem, to which we will submit the package after review by [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) collaborators), and development work will be carried out in private repositories. However, the funder will be provided with access to these private repositories so that the work can be inspected as it proceeds (typically new work is committed to the these repositories at least daily, often more frequently), thus providing direct visibility of progress, as an alternative to periodic progress reports.  

A web site documenting this project and all its outputs will also be established.

## Acknowledgement

The funder will be formally and prominently acknowledged in all outputs, including scientific papers, in R package documentation, and on the project web site.
