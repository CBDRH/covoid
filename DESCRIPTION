Description: COVOID is a R package for modelling COVID-19 and other infectious diseases using deterministic compartmental models (DCMs). It contains a built-in Shiny app enabling easy use and demonstration of key concepts to those without R programming backgrounds, along with an expanding API for simulating and estimating homogeneous and age-structured SIR, SEIR and extended models.
